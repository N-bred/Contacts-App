# Contacts-App
This is a contacts app that i created with Svelte JS, i wanted to make this because i really like Svelte, and also because i wanted to learn more about doing multiple array manipulation and rendering the data into the DOM with a lot of event handlers.

This app is kind of complex with all the DOM rendering stuff, it took me about 10 hours straight to make, but was super fun.

I really really recommend Svelte JS if you are starting to get into JS Frameworks, it's rather simple but very powerful.
